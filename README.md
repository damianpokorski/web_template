Just a compilation of packages I usually use when working on websites. Saving time!

Initial package set up:

 -  Installs following node packages:
    - Bower
    - Express

  - Install following bower packages 
    - Bootstrap
    - jQuery
    - p5 & p5.dom
    - Animate.css
    - Vue.js

  - Sets up index.html file which includes all of mentioned packages

  - Sets up index.js file which hosts public folder locally, for ease of use (just use 'node index.js' in the main folder) 

  - Sets up sketch.js file which has the initial functions required to use p5 library.

Just clone this repo, then run 'npm update' & 'bower update' and you should be good to go.
